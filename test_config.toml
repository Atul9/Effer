# This is an example config file.
# To use this, use the --config argument.
# This only applies to settings. Settings are the
# data stored in the file's header. These are
# saved to the header on use, so it's not necessary
# to use the config file on every launch.
# Here all possible values are configured.
# It's not necessary to set every setting though.
# If you're not going to use a setting, remove it
# from this file.
# If a config file is provided, all other manual
# settings like --page_size are ignored.
# All values must be passed as "strings".
