This is a small CLI program to store notes that will be saved to a text file in gibberish hex format.
To read the notes you need to use the password used to encrypt the file within the program.
It can, edit, and delete notes.
It can delete using a single number, a list, or a range.
The file can be remade (replaced with an empty one).
The password can be changed.

It uses AES256 encryption.

This is not to be taken as a real security tool. The encryption is relatively weak,
somebody that knows what they're doing might be able to decrypt it with not much problem.

Contributions are welcome.
